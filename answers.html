        </td>
        <td>SGML laid the groundwork for HTML and XML. HTML is used for structuring web content, while XML is used for data storage and transport. XHTML combines HTML syntax with XML rules, making it stricter and more compatible with XML. DHTML refers to a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating dynamic web pages, while Markdown offers a simpler syntax for formatting text-based documents.
